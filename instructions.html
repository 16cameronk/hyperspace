<p> The rules are quite Simple:
<br><br>
Navigate through the barriers and fit through the spaces. If you hit the wall you will Crash! This game tests your hand eye coordination.
<br> <br>
There are an infinite amount of levels, each level increasing in speed and distance between walls. You must first pass the Trial Level (where you are granted infinite amount of lives); after passing the Trial Level, you will be granted 5 lives in total. </p>
